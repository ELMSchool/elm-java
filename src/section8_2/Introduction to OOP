Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

There are 4 major concepts of OOP
---------------------------------
Encapsulation -> binding and hiding certain class fields or actions from user

Intheritance -> passing along the common properties/fields and actions to subclasses that shares common concepts

Abstraction ->  concept of creating a true 'concept' of a class without giving the ability to create the object out of it

Polymorphsim -> the concept of doing the same thing, creating the same object with the ability to do so differently
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Other conpets of OOP
--------------------

Association -> One to One, One to Many, Many to One, Many to Many

Aggregation -> it is type of Association where object demonstrates HAS-A relationship

Composition -> it is a special type of Association where objects demonstrate a strongly coupled HAS-A relationship so that if a composing object is 'destroyed', the composed object will be 'destroyed' as well. 

Cohesion -> it is the idea of cohesion is to provide well-defined and connected actions or group of actions in the code.
